# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to find useful and relevant information that will help Louis make the best decisions on how to launch her kickstarter campaign.
## Analysis and Challenges
I performed the analysis by first looking at info that was only related to Louise’s interests. So, I filtered to look at the outcomes of campaigns in the theater category and how they compared to the others.

After seeing the success of theater campaigns in the past, I looked more specifically at plays. Plays were the most successful subcategory of theater, and overall.

Furthermore, I looked at the amounts of the goals versus what was pledged to see if there was any correlation between them and the campaign’s outcome. Lastly, I compared the outcomes of theater campaigns while looking at their launch dates to uncover any trends.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on Launch Date, it appears the best months to start a campaign have been May and June over the years. The most failed campaigns were launched in May, June, July, and October. So, it is my recommendation to avoid launching campaigns during those months, if possible. There may be a factor about summer months causing the high failure rate.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The most goals were met when the amount was less than 5000. The second most were for amounts between 35000 and 45000. Very few goals are met if the amounts are greater than 45000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The dataset is so big that the amount of information could be overwhelming. So, one challenge could be deciphering which information you need, and which is irrelevant.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? May is a good month to launch a campaign. May, June, July, and October are not the best months to launch a successful campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
More successful campaigns have smaller goals. of less than 5000.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There is no data on the genres of plays. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? We could look at Outcomes based on number of backers or Outcomes based on Staff Picks
